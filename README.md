## About Outspell Game
Outspell is a fast, modern word game that plays right in your browser. Build high-scoring words, chain multipliers, and out-think your opponent with flexible rack management. It’s simple to start yet deep enough for players who love vocabulary, optimization, and clever board control.

Gameplay overview: Draw seven tiles and connect letters horizontally or vertically to form valid words. Score comes from letter values and board multipliers; using all 7 tiles earns a bingo bonus. Play solo against a computer opponent.

A typical Outspell round runs a few minutes, perfect for a quick break. The rhythm is satisfying: draft, place, score, and plan your next turn. You’ll learn to spot high-value overlaps, deny premium squares, and pivot when draws are awkward.

Because Outspell runs in the browser, there’s no friction—no installs or accounts. It’s great for short sessions at school, work, or home. With practice, you’ll start seeing patterns, anticipating opponent replies, and lining up big scoring turns.

In short, Outspell is easy to pick up and surprisingly deep. Build strong foundations, stretch to multipliers when the board allows, and close out with efficient rack dumps. Whether you’re aiming to beat your personal best or relaxing with a quick puzzle, Outspell keeps the challenge engaging and the learning curve friendly.
